This is the final project for MSU CMSE830: Foundation of Data Science.

This web app offers an in-depth exploration of the Molecular Similarity Perception dataset.

Within the app, you will visualize the distribution of individual features in the dataset, explore the interconnections between various features,and compare different models for predicting whether experienced chemists will perceive a pair of molecules as similar.
